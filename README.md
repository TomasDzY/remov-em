# Remov-em 🧹
Tired of ChatGPT giving you away with those dramatic and totally overused em dashes(—)?

Remov-em is a simple Chrome extension that removes those weird dashes from ChatGPT responses so your posts, emails, and messages don’t scream “written by AI.”

## Why use it?
ChatGPT loves em dashes.
People notice.
Remov-em makes your writing look more natural - like you actually wrote it.

## How it works:
Install the extension

Open ChatGPT

Poof - no more em dashes

Copy and paste like a normal human

No settings, no tracking, no fuss.
Just clean text.
